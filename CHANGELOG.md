## [1.3.13] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- **UI Development Pipeline section to INSTRUCTIONS.md** — added comprehensive 3-phase pipeline documentation, 24-entry available slash commands table, and 5 rules for all agents. This file is loaded by every agent, so all agents now know about the pipeline and impeccable commands.
- **24 OpenCode slash commands for Impeccable** — created command files in `.opencode/commands/` so OpenCode recognizes `/impeccable` and all 22 subcommands. Includes main `impeccable.md` (with full command reference table) plus pinned shortcuts: `/critique`, `/audit`, `/polish`, `/craft`, `/shape`, `/init`, `/live`, `/document`, `/extract`, `/harden`, `/layout`, `/typeset`, `/colorize`, `/animate`, `/distill`, `/clarify`, `/adapt`, `/bolder`, `/quieter`, `/delight`, `/overdrive`, `/optimize`, `/onboard`, `/hooks`.

### Fixed

- **`/impeccable` returns "No matching items"** — OpenCode slash commands require `.md` files in `.opencode/commands/`. Without these files, none of the impeccable commands were discoverable in OpenCode.

## [1.3.12] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- **`flutter-dio-multi-service` skill** — Multi-microservice Dio patterns for Flutter: shared `PersistCookieJar` across 5+ Dio instances, cookie-based auth with `cookie_jar` + `dio_cookie_manager`, Bearer token fallback for cross-origin services, `AuthInterceptor` with 401 detection on both `onResponse` and `onError`, static `onUnauthorized` callback bridging Dio to Riverpod, `ApiService` thin typed wrapper, `ApiResponseHelper` dual-format response envelope parser (`status`/`success`), `CursorPage<T>` generic pagination model, dual-layer error hierarchy (`Exception` + `Failure`), service-specific env config via `--dart-define-from-file`, Auth Bridge (`AuthRouterBridge` + `Future.microtask` deferral + multi-state redirect), and complete testing patterns. Extracted from `olpos_business_owner_dashboard` reference project.
- **`flutter-dashboard-patterns` skill** — Production dashboard UI patterns for Flutter: animation tokens system (durations, curves, spring physics, staggered entrance helpers), 4 GoRouter custom page transitions (`fadeScale`, `slide`, `sharedAxis`, `fade`) with `prefers-reduced-motion` support, `GlassCard`/`OlposGlassCard` glassmorphism components with glow border, `PressScaleWrapper` tactile feedback, `GradientStatCard` with `AnimatedCounter` number roll-up, `AppShimmer`/`AppLoading` skeleton states, `AppErrorWidget` shake animation on error, `EmptyStateWidget` staggered entrance, `SectionHeader`/`StatusBadge`/`GlowDot` supporting widgets, multi-tenant store selection with `FlutterSecureStorage` persistence, schema-based feature visibility via Riverpod `Provider` switch, and cross-provider invalidation on store change.
- **Auth Bridge Riverpod→GoRouter** to `flutter-state-management` (§3.6) — `AuthRouterBridge` with `refreshListenable`, `Future.microtask` deferral to avoid notification cycle races, static `onUnauthorized` callback wiring Dio interceptor to Riverpod, safe `setUnauthenticated()` (no API call — prevents infinite loop), and multi-state redirect handling 3 auth states (`AuthChecking`/`AuthInitial`/`AuthAuthenticated`) with splash screen.
- **Derived & Computed Providers** to `flutter-state-management` (§2.9) — `Provider` for schema-based feature visibility (`salesDashboardVisibilityProvider`), boolean flags from entities (`isVariantProvider`, `isSchemaLaundryProvider`), and auto-redirect via `ref.listen` on derived provider changes.
- **Production `analysis_options.yaml` template** to `dart-run-static-analysis` — 231-rule template covering core Dart lint, Flutter-specific rules, and SonarQube Dart rule set, plus a minimal template for simple projects.

### Changed

- **All 23 impeccable commands mapped to pipeline phases** — `it-leader.md` now includes a complete command-to-phase mapping table and expanded pipeline diagram showing every command in its primary phase (10 in Phase 1 Design, 11 in Phase 2 Implementation, 9 in Phase 3 QA).
- **Frontend polish gate expanded** — Both `nuxt-frontend-developer.md` and `react-frontend-developer.md` now list 9 commands in the polish gate: core (critique, audit, polish) + extended (harden, adapt, optimize, clarify, onboard, live).
- **Designer command-by-phase table** — `ui-ux-designer.md` now has a Command-by-Phase Reference table grouping all 23 commands into Design, Implement, and Design QA phases.
- `flutter-developer.md`: registered `flutter-dio-multi-service` and `flutter-dashboard-patterns` in Contextual Skills (with task descriptions) and Skills list

---

### Added

- **UI Development Pipeline** — Formal 3-phase protocol for all UI tasks in `it-leader.md`: Phase 1 (Design by `@designer` with impeccable), Phase 2 (Implementation by `@frontend` with impeccable polish gate), Phase 3 (Design QA by `@designer`). Includes pipeline diagram, rules, and delegation template.
- **Impeccable Polish Gate for frontend agents** — `nuxt-frontend-developer.md` and `react-frontend-developer.md` now mandate running `/impeccable critique`, `/impeccable audit`, and `/impeccable polish` before marking any UI implementation as `verified`.
- **Phase 3: Design QA Protocol for `@designer`** — `ui-ux-designer.md` now includes a complete post-implementation QA protocol with impeccable critique scoring, live browser verification, and PASS/FAIL reporting format.
- **Delegation template for UI features** — `it-leader.md` now includes a ready-to-use 3-phase delegation contract template for any UI task.

### Changed

- **IT Leader Definition of Done** — Frontend layer now requires "designer QA verified" and "impeccable polish gate passed".
- **Designer Output Contract** — Updated to reflect 3-phase pipeline: Phase 2 handoff + Phase 3 QA verdict + final pipeline status.
- **Designer Step 5 Handoff** — Now explicitly tells frontend to hand back for Design QA after implementation.

### Removed

- **`design-system` skill from `@designer` prompt** — removed all 6 references to the conflicting `design-system` skill from `ui-ux-designer.md`. This skill directly competed with `/impeccable document` (DESIGN.md generation), `/impeccable critique` (visual audit), and `/impeccable audit` (AI slop detection). Replaced with direct `/impeccable document` + `/impeccable extract` references.
- **`design-system` and `frontend-design-direction` skill files** — deleted both skill directories from `.opencode/skills/` to prevent OpenCode from auto-loading them.

### Fixed

- **No conflicting design skills** — `design-system` and `frontend-design-direction` skills both had overlapping design direction, audit, and anti-pattern detection that conflicted with impeccable's 23 commands. Removing `design-system` from `@designer` prompt ensures the designer follows a single, consistent design intelligence engine.
- **Unbounded impeccable references** — removed limiting parenthetical scopes like `(critique + audit reference files)` and `(critique + polish + brand)` from all agent prompts. Impeccable has 23 commands and should not be restricted to a subset. Updated descriptions in `nuxt-frontend-developer.md`, `react-frontend-developer.md`, `flutter-developer.md`, and `angular-developer.md` to describe it as "Full 23-command design intelligence engine".

## [1.3.10] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- **Mandatory Impeccable Protocol for `@designer`** — UI/UX Designer agent prompt now includes a MANDATORY section at the top requiring `impeccable` skill to be loaded at step 0 of every design task. Includes full 23-command reference table and 31 URLs to impeccable.style docs.
- **Strengthened DESIGN TASK RULE for `@leader`** — IT Leader prompt now explicitly states that ALL design/UI/visual critique tasks must be delegated to `@designer`, and that `@designer` uses `/impeccable` as its primary design intelligence engine.
- **`@designer` subagent documentation** — IT Leader prompt's `@designer` section updated with direct documentation URLs and explicit list of `/impeccable` commands.
- **Updated `@designer` Skill Loading Guidelines** — upgraded from "always load first" recommendation to mandatory requirement with clear "MUST load" table.

### Fixed

- **Impeccable skill script paths** — all 35 occurrences of `node .agents/skills/impeccable/scripts/...` across SKILL.md, 5 reference files (`critique.md`, `hooks.md`, `init.md`, `polish.md`, `live.md`), and `scripts/hook-admin.mjs` changed to `node .opencode/skills/impeccable/scripts/...` for OpenCode path compatibility.

### Added

- **`agent-memory-workflow` skill** — disciplined cross-session memory protocol: mandatory recall ritual at session start, structured save at session end, 5 memory categories (preference, architecture, convention, lesson, session), auto-save triggers, memory audit procedures, and cross-agent discipline (IT Leader mediates subagent memory writes)
- **`agent-delegation-contract` skill** — structured contract template for agent-to-agent delegation with: scope & out-of-scope, input interface, expected output, verification criteria, memory context. Includes subagent response contract format, chain vs parallel rules, and contract violation protocol
- **`progress-tracking` skill** — multi-step task tracking with lifecycle (BACKLOG → TODO → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW → DONE), hierarchical task IDs (FE-001, BE-002), visual progress tables with emoji status markers, session-boundary handoff protocol, and cross-agent status protocol
- **`/status` command** — one-shot visual progress report with task table, priority, blocker detection, and overall completion stats
- **`/continue` command** — 3-step session recovery protocol after `/reset` or context compression: memory recall, codebase reconciliation, user-facing status report
- **IT Leader prompt** — delegation protocol now uses structured contract template from `agent-delegation-contract` skill; new Progress Tracking section with task ID convention and visual reporting mandate
- **Global installation system** — `opencode-agent-kit init --global` installs the full kit to the platform-specific OpenCode config directory, where OpenCode discovers it automatically:
  - macOS/Linux: `~/.config/opencode/` (respects `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`)
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\opencode\`
  - Override: `$OPENCODE_HOME` env var
- **Flat install structure** — template's `.opencode/` contents are copied directly into the global directory (no `.opencode` wrapper), with config paths rewritten: `.opencode/skills/...` → `skills/...`
- **JSONC config merging** — reads existing `opencode.jsonc` (JSON with comments), strips comments, merges with template's `opencode.json` entries (instructions, agents, MCP servers), preserves existing provider/model/MCP config
- **`opencode-agent-kit link`** command — on macOS/Linux, reports that OpenCode auto-detects the global config; on Windows, creates a junction from `.opencode/` → global dir
- **`opencode-agent-kit global`** command — subcommands: `path` (print path), `status` (show version + contents), `update` (re-install latest)
- **Smart `init`** — now defaults to local copy (since OpenCode auto-discovers global config). Use `--global` for system-wide install, `--local` to force local copy
- **`global-install` skill** — comprehensive documentation of the global install design, cross-platform path resolution, JSONC merging, and edge cases
- **`bin/commands/global-path.mjs`** — shared utility: `getOpenCodeHome()`, `globalInstallExists()`
- **JSONC parser** — `parseJsonc()` strips `//` and `/* */` comments and trailing commas for safe JSON parsing
- **`doctor` command update** — checks for global install at `~/.config/opencode/`, reports version and status

### Changed

- `opencode.json`: instructions array now includes 4 new skills (agent-memory-workflow, agent-delegation-contract, progress-tracking, global-install) — 17 total
- `.opencode/instructions/INSTRUCTIONS.md`: 4 new subsections (Memory Workflow, Delegation Contracts, Progress Tracking, Global Install)
- `.opencode/skills/agent-session-workflow/SKILL.md`: session start template now mandates memory recall protocol + `/continue` for resumed sessions
- `bin/commands/init.mjs`: refactored into 3 modes (`--global` installs flat into `~/.config/opencode/`, `--local` copies into `.opencode/`, default is local). Includes `parseJsonc()`, `rewriteTemplatePathsForGlobal()`, and `mergeJson()` with updated strategy
- `bin/commands/global-path.mjs`: renamed to `getOpenCodeHome()` / `globalInstallExists()`, uses `~/.config/opencode/` (was `~/.config/opencode-agent-kit/kit/`)
- `bin/init.mjs`: registered `link` and `global` subcommands with `--global`/`--local` flags on `init`
- `bin/commands/global-cmd.mjs`: uses `getOpenCodeHome()`, reads `.kit-version` from OpenCode home
- `bin/commands/doctor.mjs`: imports `getOpenCodeHome` from `global-path.mjs`
- `bin/commands/link.mjs`: on macOS/Linux, reports auto-detection; on Windows, delegates to init's `linkProject`

## [1.3.6] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- **Windows global install path** — corrected from `%APPDATA%\opencode\` to `%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\` to match official OpenCode documentation. The previous path (`%APPDATA%`) would have caused OpenCode to not find the agent kit on Windows.
- **Official path reference** — all paths now confirmed against [opencode.ai/docs/config/](https://opencode.ai/docs/config/) (Global: `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` on macOS/Linux, `%USERPROFILE%\.config\opencode\` on Windows)
- **Absolute paths in global config** — `rewriteTemplatePathsForGlobal()` now produces **absolute paths** (e.g. `/Users/user/.config/opencode/skills/...`) instead of relative paths (`skills/...`). This is critical because OpenCode resolves config paths relative to the **current project directory**, not relative to `~/.config/opencode/`. Relative paths would cause all skill, instruction, and agent references to fail in every project.

### Changed

- `bin/commands/global-path.mjs`: Windows path uses `USERPROFILE` + `.config\opencode` instead of `APPDATA`
- `package.json`: version bumped to 1.3.6
- `.opencode/skills/global-install/SKILL.md`: all Windows path references corrected

## [1.3.7] - 2026-06-27

### Notes

- **Prose `.opencode/` references** (64 occurrences across 17 skill/docs/prompt files) are intentionally **not rewritten** during global install. These are informational text for the LLM, not config paths resolved by OpenCode. The critical fix (absolute config paths in `opencode.jsonc`) was already shipped in v1.3.6.

### Changed

- `package.json`: version bumped to 1.3.7

### Fixed

- **All `.opencode/` references in global config** — `rewriteTemplatePathsForGlobal()` now rewrites paths in all 4 locations:
  - `instructions[]` — absolute path ✅
  - `agent.*.prompt` — rewrites `{file:.opencode/...}` → `{file:/abs/path/...}` ✅
  - `mcp.*.command[]` — rewrites `.opencode/hooks/...` in command arrays ✅
  - `plugin[]` — rewrites `.opencode/plugins/...` → absolute path ✅

### Notes

- Prose `.opencode/` references inside skill files, agent prompts, and docs (64 occurrences across 17 files) are intentionally **not rewritten** — these are informational text for the LLM, not config paths resolved by OpenCode.

## [1.3.8] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- **All `.opencode/` paths in global config** — `rewriteTemplatePathsForGlobal()` now rewrites paths in all config sections: `instructions[]`, `agent.*.prompt` (`{file:...}` wrapper), `mcp.*.command[]`, and `plugin[]`. Previously only `instructions[]` and `agent.*.file` were handled, leaving broken `.opencode/` references in MCP commands, agent prompts, and plugin paths.

### Changed

- `bin/commands/init.mjs`: `rewriteTemplatePathsForGlobal()` now handles 4 path locations with regex for `{file:...}` wrapper syntax, array mapping for MCP commands, and string mapping for plugins
- `.opencode/skills/global-install/SKILL.md`: documented all 4 path rewrite locations with table
- `package.json`: version bumped to 1.3.8

### Fixed

- **`copyRecursive` no longer overwrites existing files** — `copyFileSync` is now gated by `!existsSync(destPath)`. Previously every file in directories (skills/, prompts/, commands/, etc.) was overwritten on re-install, destroying any user modifications.
- **`global update` no longer uses `--force`** — changed from `force: true` to `quiet: true`. Previously `global update` passed `force: true` which triggered `source-wins` strategy, overwriting all user-customized agents with template defaults. Now it uses merge strategy (preserves user changes).
- **New `--yes` flag** — added `--yes` to `init` command for auto-confirm merge without overwriting. Semantics: `--yes` skips the confirmation prompt but still uses merge strategy. `--force` skips prompt AND overwrites with template (destructive).

### Changed

- `bin/commands/init.mjs`: `installGlobal()` prompt now checks `options.quiet` (auto-confirm) separately from `options.force` (overwrite). `copyRecursive()` only copies non-existing files. `init()` maps `--yes` → `options.quiet`.
  |- `bin/commands/global-cmd.mjs`: `cmdUpdate()` passes `quiet: true` instead of `force: true` to `init()`.
  |- `bin/init.mjs`: added `--yes` option to `init` command.

## [1.3.9] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- **User config preservation on re-install** — three issues that caused user modifications to `opencode.jsonc` and global files to be lost:
  - `copyRecursive()` no longer overwrites existing files (only copies new ones)
  - `global update` uses `quiet: true` (merge) instead of `force: true` (overwrite)
  - New `--yes` flag for safe auto-confirm merge (separate from destructive `--force`)

### Changed

- `bin/commands/init.mjs`: `copyRecursive()` gated by `!existsSync(destPath)`; `installGlobal()` uses `options.quiet` for prompt skip; `init()` maps `--yes` → `quiet`
- `bin/commands/global-cmd.mjs`: `cmdUpdate()` passes `quiet: true` instead of `force: true`
- `bin/init.mjs`: added `--yes` option to `init` command
- `package.json`: version bumped to 1.3.9

## [1.3.4] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- **SonarQube as primary agent** — mode changed from `subagent` to `primary`; SonarQube Quality Auditor can now be selected as a standalone agent, not just a subagent of IT Leader
- **Bug/Error Fix Protocol** — new 4-step mandatory protocol in `it-leader.md`: classify issue → read context only (never edit) → delegate immediately to domain subagent → verify the fix; ensures leader never edits code directly

### Changed

- **Agent prompts relocated** — all 34 agent `.md` files moved from `.opencode/agents/` → `.opencode/prompts/agents/`; OpenCode auto-detection now driven solely by `opencode.json`
- `opencode.json`: all `{file:.opencode/agents/...}` paths updated to `{file:.opencode/prompts/agents/...}`; SonarQube agent description updated
- `opencode.example.json`: mirrored path and mode changes
- `bin/commands/doctor.mjs`: agent path check updated to `prompts/agents/`
- `bin/commands/init.mjs`: summary display updated to `prompts/agents/`
- `bin/commands/validate.mjs`: agent validation directory updated to `prompts/agents/`
- `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`: all `.opencode/agents/` references updated
- `schema/opencode-config.schema.json`, `index-old.html`: example paths updated
- `.opencode/prompts/agents/nuxt-frontend-developer-mentor.md`: internal cross-reference paths updated
- `.opencode/skills/android-kotlin-compose/SKILL.md`: agent reference path updated
- `it-leader.md`: added DELEGATION MANDATE, Bug/Error Fix classification, stronger delegation enforcement, and 10 new delegation examples for bug/error fixes

---

## [1.2.11] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- **Versioned Migration System** — `.opencode/migrations/` with sequential migration scripts (v1.0.0 → ongoing), auto-detection on version upgrade, `opencode-agent-kit migrate` CLI command with `--dry-run` and `--rollback` support, snapshot backup before each migration, and auto-migration check integrated into `init` and `doctor` commands
- **CI/CD Validation Pipeline** — GitHub Actions workflow (`validation.yml`) running on every PR and push to main that validates `opencode.json` schema integrity, ensures all agent keys map to existing prompt files, checks YAML frontmatter in all `SKILL.md` files, verifies MCP configuration consistency, detects orphan agent files, and more
- **Validation Script** — `.opencode/scripts/validate.mjs` standalone validator runnable locally or in CI with color-coded output

### Fixed

- **MCP Configuration** — Figma and Stitch MCP servers now have explicit `"enabled": false` to match their disabled status
- **Skill Validation** — frontmatter checks scoped to `SKILL.md` files only, avoiding false positives from non-skill markdown files

## [1.2.10] - 2026-06-20

### Changed

---

## [1.2.8] - 2025-06-19

### Added

- **Safe bash command permissions** — 17 non-aggressive bash patterns (`ls`, `pwd`, `which`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `echo`, etc.) auto-allowed at both top-level and per-agent level, reducing permission prompts by ~90%
- **Read-only tool permissions** — `glob`, `grep`, `list` set to `"allow"` at top-level (no more prompts for file search)
- **`agentmemory_*` centralized** — moved from per-agent duplication (33 agents × 1 line) to top-level permission
- **`figma_*` centralized** — set to `"deny"` at top-level (Figma MCP disabled, no Figma clutter in unrelated agents)

### Changed

- **`external_directory`** — relaxed from `"ask"` to `"allow"` with deny rules for sensitive dirs (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.config`, `~/secrets`)
- **`skill` permission** — per-agent `{"*": "allow"}` → shorthand `"allow"` (cleaner config)
- **`opencode.example.json`** — same permission improvements applied to the example config
