# Everything Claude Code - OpenCode Instructions

This document consolidates the core rules and guidelines from the Claude Code configuration for use with OpenCode.

## Security Guidelines (CRITICAL)

### Mandatory Security Checks

Before ANY commit:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] Authentication/authorization verified
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive data

### Secret Management

```typescript
// NEVER: Hardcoded secrets
const apiKey = 'sk-proj-xxxxx';

// ALWAYS: Environment variables
const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;

if (!apiKey) {
  throw new Error('OPENAI_API_KEY not configured');
}
```

### Security Response Protocol

If security issue found:

1. STOP immediately
2. Use **security-reviewer** agent
3. Fix CRITICAL issues before continuing
4. Rotate any exposed secrets
5. Review entire codebase for similar issues

---

## Coding Style

### Immutability (CRITICAL)

ALWAYS create new objects, NEVER mutate:

```javascript
// WRONG: Mutation
function updateUser(user, name) {
  user.name = name; // MUTATION!
  return user;
}

// CORRECT: Immutability
function updateUser(user, name) {
  return {
    ...user,
    name,
  };
}
```

### File Organization

MANY SMALL FILES > FEW LARGE FILES:

- High cohesion, low coupling
- 200-400 lines typical, 800 max
- Extract utilities from large components
- Organize by feature/domain, not by type

### Error Handling

ALWAYS handle errors comprehensively:

```typescript
try {
  const result = await riskyOperation();
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Operation failed:', error);
  throw new Error('Detailed user-friendly message');
}
```

### Input Validation

ALWAYS validate user input:

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  age: z.number().int().min(0).max(150),
});

const validated = schema.parse(input);
```

### Code Quality Checklist

Before marking work complete:

- [ ] Code is readable and well-named
- [ ] Functions are small (<50 lines)
- [ ] Files are focused (<800 lines)
- [ ] No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No console.log statements
- [ ] No hardcoded values
- [ ] No mutation (immutable patterns used)

---

## Testing Requirements

### Minimum Test Coverage: 80%

Test Types (ALL required):

1. **Unit Tests** - Individual functions, utilities, components
2. **Integration Tests** - API endpoints, database operations
3. **E2E Tests** - Critical user flows (Playwright)

### Test-Driven Development

MANDATORY workflow:

1. Write test first (RED)
2. Run test - it should FAIL
3. Write minimal implementation (GREEN)
4. Run test - it should PASS
5. Refactor (IMPROVE)
6. Verify coverage (80%+)

### Troubleshooting Test Failures

1. Use **tdd-guide** agent
2. Check test isolation
3. Verify mocks are correct
4. Fix implementation, not tests (unless tests are wrong)

---

## Git Workflow

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <description>

<optional body>
```

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

### Pull Request Workflow

When creating PRs:

1. Analyze full commit history (not just latest commit)
2. Use `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to see all changes
3. Draft comprehensive PR summary
4. Include test plan with TODOs
5. Push with `-u` flag if new branch

### Feature Implementation Workflow

1. **Plan First**
   - Use **planner** agent to create implementation plan
   - Identify dependencies and risks
   - Break down into phases

2. **TDD Approach**
   - Use **tdd-guide** agent
   - Write tests first (RED)
   - Implement to pass tests (GREEN)
   - Refactor (IMPROVE)
   - Verify 80%+ coverage

3. **Code Review**
   - Use **code-reviewer** agent immediately after writing code
   - Address CRITICAL and HIGH issues
   - Fix MEDIUM issues when possible

4. **Commit & Push**
   - Detailed commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format

---

## Agent Orchestration

### Available Agents

| Agent                | Purpose                 | When to Use                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| planner              | Implementation planning | Complex features, refactoring |
| architect            | System design           | Architectural decisions       |
| tdd-guide            | Test-driven development | New features, bug fixes       |
| code-reviewer        | Code review             | After writing code            |
| security-reviewer    | Security analysis       | Before commits                |
| build-error-resolver | Fix build errors        | When build fails              |
| e2e-runner           | E2E testing             | Critical user flows           |
| refactor-cleaner     | Dead code cleanup       | Code maintenance              |
| doc-updater          | Documentation           | Updating docs                 |
| go-reviewer          | Go code review          | Go projects                   |
| go-build-resolver    | Go build errors         | Go build failures             |
| database-reviewer    | Database optimization   | SQL, schema design            |

### Immediate Agent Usage

No user prompt needed:

1. Complex feature requests - Use **planner** agent
2. Code just written/modified - Use **code-reviewer** agent
3. Bug fix or new feature - Use **tdd-guide** agent
4. Architectural decision - Use **architect** agent

---

## Performance Optimization

### Model Selection Strategy

**Haiku** (90% of Sonnet capability, 3x cost savings):

- Lightweight agents with frequent invocation
- Pair programming and code generation
- Worker agents in multi-agent systems

**Sonnet** (Best coding model):

- Main development work
- Orchestrating multi-agent workflows
- Complex coding tasks

**Opus** (Deepest reasoning):

- Complex architectural decisions
- Maximum reasoning requirements
- Research and analysis tasks

### Context Window Management

Avoid last 20% of context window for:

- Large-scale refactoring
- Feature implementation spanning multiple files
- Debugging complex interactions

### Build Troubleshooting

If build fails:

1. Use **build-error-resolver** agent
2. Analyze error messages
3. Fix incrementally
4. Verify after each fix

---

## Common Patterns

### API Response Format

```typescript
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: string;
  meta?: {
    total: number;
    page: number;
    limit: number;
  };
}
```

### Composable Pattern (Vue/Nuxt)

```typescript
export function useDebounce<T>(value: Ref<T>, delay: number): Readonly<Ref<T>> {
  const debouncedValue = ref<T>(value.value) as Ref<T>;

  watch(value, () => {
    const handler = setTimeout(() => {
      debouncedValue.value = value.value;
    }, delay);

    onScopeDispose(() => clearTimeout(handler));
  });

  return readonly(debouncedValue);
}
```

### Repository Pattern

```typescript
interface Repository<T> {
  findAll(filters?: Filters): Promise<T[]>;
  findById(id: string): Promise<T | null>;
  create(data: CreateDto): Promise<T>;
  update(id: string, data: UpdateDto): Promise<T>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

## OpenCode-Specific Notes

Since OpenCode does not support hooks, the following actions that were automated in Claude Code must be done manually:

### After Writing/Editing Code

- Run `prettier --write <file>` to format JS/TS files
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check for TypeScript errors
- Check for console.log statements and remove them

### Before Committing

- Run security checks manually
- Verify no secrets in code
- Run full test suite

### Commands Available

Use these commands in OpenCode:

- `/plan` - Create implementation plan
- `/tdd` - Enforce TDD workflow
- `/code-review` - Review code changes
- `/security` - Run security review
- `/build-fix` - Fix build errors
- `/e2e` - Generate E2E tests
- `/refactor-clean` - Remove dead code
- `/orchestrate` - Multi-agent workflow

---

## Mobile Development

### Android (Kotlin / Jetpack Compose)

**Default Stack:**

- Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Material Design 3, XML, Gradle KTS (version catalog)
- Hilt for DI, Room for local DB, Retrofit + OkHttp for networking
- Jetpack Navigation Compose, WorkManager

**Build Commands:**

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug                  # Debug build
./gradlew assembleRelease                # Release APK
./gradlew bundleRelease                  # Play Store AAB
./gradlew test                           # Unit tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest           # Instrumented tests
```

**Play Store Publishing (via GPC):**

1. `gpc preflight <aab>` — Compliance check
2. `gpc publish --track internal` — Upload to internal track
3. `gpc release promote --from internal --to production` — Promote

### Flutter (Dart / Flutter SDK)

**Default Stack:**

- Dart, Flutter SDK, Material Design 3, Cupertino
- Bloc or Riverpod for state management
- GoRouter for routing, Dio for networking
- Hive/Isar/Drift for local storage

## Agentmemory: Persistent Cross-Session Memory

agentmemory provides persistent memory for all agents. It captures session history, saves decisions/insights, and injects relevant context from past sessions into the current session.

### Prerequisites

```bash
npm install -g @agentmemory/agentmemory   # Install globally
agentmemory                                # Start server on :3111
```

### MCP Tools (53 tools)

All agents have access to agentmemory MCP tools prefixed with `agentmemory_memory_`:

| Tool                       | Purpose                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `memory_save`              | Save insights, decisions, facts to long-term memory     |
| `memory_recall`            | Search past observations by keywords                    |
| `memory_smart_search`      | Hybrid semantic+keyword search for conceptual queries   |
| `memory_sessions`          | List recent sessions with status and observation counts |
| `memory_file_history`      | Get past observations about specific files              |
| `memory_lesson_save`       | Save a lesson learned with confidence scoring           |
| `memory_lesson_recall`     | Search lessons by query, sorted by confidence           |
| `memory_governance_delete` | Delete specific memories (requires confirmation)        |
| `memory_patterns`          | Detect recurring patterns across sessions               |
| `memory_consolidate`       | Run 4-tier memory consolidation pipeline                |

### Available Commands

- `/recall [query]` — Search past observations and lessons
- `/remember [text]` — Explicitly save an insight to long-term memory

### Auto-Capture Plugin

The `agentmemory-capture.ts` plugin (registered in `opencode.json`) captures 22 lifecycle events automatically:

- Session lifecycle: created, idle, compacted, updated, deleted, error
- Messages & prompts: user messages, assistant responses, removed messages
- Parts & steps: subagent starts, tool calls, reasoning, step-finish, patches, compaction events
- File enrichment: auto-injects file-specific context into system prompt
- Permissions: captures permission prompts and replies
- Tasks & commands: captures todo changes and command execution

### Skills

The `agentmemory` skill (`.opencode/skills/agentmemory/SKILL.md`) teaches agents when and how to use the memory tools effectively.

### Memory Workflow

The `agent-memory-workflow` skill (`.opencode/skills/agent-memory-workflow/SKILL.md`) provides disciplined protocols:

- **Session Start Ritual**: Mandatory memory recall before any productive work
- **Session End Ritual**: Structured save before session ends or compacts
- **Auto-Save Triggers**: When to save mid-session without waiting
- **Memory Audit**: Periodic hygiene and deduplication
- **Cross-Agent Memory**: Subagents don't write memory directly — IT Leader mediates

### Delegation Contracts

The `agent-delegation-contract` skill (`.opencode/skills/agent-delegation-contract/SKILL.md`) provides:

- **Standard Contract Template**: Structured brief with scope, input interface, output contract
- **Subagent Response Contract**: Mandatory result format including verification status
- **Chain vs Parallel Rules**: When to sequence vs parallelise delegations
- **Contract Violation Protocol**: How to handle out-of-scope work

### Progress Tracking

The `progress-tracking` skill (`.opencode/skills/progress-tracking/SKILL.md`) provides:

- **Task Lifecycle**: BACKLOG → TODO → IN_PROGRESS → REVIEW → DONE
- **Task ID Convention**: Hierarchical IDs (FE-001, BE-002) for cross-reference
- **Visual Progress Reports**: Tables with status emojis for user communication
- **Cross-Agent Protocol**: IT Leader maintains master list; subagents report results
- **Session Handoff**: How to recover task state after `/reset` or new session

---

## opencode-agent-kit Version Check

If `.opencode/.kit-version` exists, your agent toolkit has a recorded installed version.

**At session start**, check for updates:

1. Read `.opencode/.kit-version` to get the installed version
2. Run `npm view opencode-agent-kit version` to get the latest
3. If latest > installed, notify the user with the update command

This applies to IT-Leader (primary) and frontend/backend subagents when called directly.

### Global Install

The `global-install` skill (`.opencode/skills/global-install/SKILL.md`) documents the global installation approach. On macOS, OpenCode auto-discovers the global config at `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc`. If the kit was installed globally, note that:

- Skills, prompts, commands, and instructions are stored flat in `~/.config/opencode/`
- `opencode.jsonc` is merged with your existing config (providers, MCP, etc.)
- No per-project `.opencode/` is needed — OpenCode reads the global config automatically
- To update: run `opencode-agent-kit global update`
- To install per-project: run `opencode-agent-kit init --local`

## UI Development Pipeline

This project uses a **3-phase UI Development Pipeline** for ALL UI-related tasks. Every agent involved in UI work must follow this protocol.

### The 3 Phases

```
PHASE 1 — DESIGN (@designer)
  │ Load `impeccable` skill (mandatory step 0)
  │ Use: /impeccable init, /impeccable shape, /impeccable critique
  │ Define: tokens, DESIGN.md, specs, states, a11y requirements
  │ Handoff to @frontend-nuxt / @frontend-react
  ▼
PHASE 2 — IMPLEMENT (@frontend)
  │ Implement from design specs
  │ MUST run Impeccable Polish Gate before done:
  │   /impeccable critique + /impeccable audit + /impeccable polish
  │ Extended: /impeccable harden, adapt, optimize, clarify, onboard, live
  │ Handoff to @designer for Phase 3 QA
  ▼
PHASE 3 — DESIGN QA (@designer)
  │ /impeccable critique on live result
  │ Verify: tokens, a11y, states, responsive, copy
  │ Report: PASS ✅ → done | FAIL ❌ → back to Phase 2
```

### Available Slash Commands

All Impeccable commands are available as OpenCode slash commands:

| Command                 | Shortcut     | Purpose                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `/impeccable`           | —            | Main entry (23 subcommands)   |
| `/impeccable critique`  | `/critique`  | Full design review            |
| `/impeccable audit`     | `/audit`     | a11y, perf, responsive checks |
| `/impeccable polish`    | `/polish`    | Final quality pass            |
| `/impeccable craft`     | `/craft`     | End-to-end design + build     |
| `/impeccable shape`     | `/shape`     | UX planning                   |
| `/impeccable init`      | `/init`      | Setup context files           |
| `/impeccable live`      | `/live`      | Browser iteration             |
| `/impeccable document`  | `/document`  | Generate DESIGN.md            |
| `/impeccable extract`   | `/extract`   | Pull tokens                   |
| `/impeccable harden`    | `/harden`    | Edge cases                    |
| `/impeccable layout`    | `/layout`    | Spacing/rhythm                |
| `/impeccable typeset`   | `/typeset`   | Typography                    |
| `/impeccable colorize`  | `/colorize`  | Color                         |
| `/impeccable animate`   | `/animate`   | Motion                        |
| `/impeccable distill`   | `/distill`   | Simplify                      |
| `/impeccable clarify`   | `/clarify`   | UX copy                       |
| `/impeccable adapt`     | `/adapt`     | Responsive                    |
| `/impeccable bolder`    | `/bolder`    | Amplify                       |
| `/impeccable quieter`   | `/quieter`   | Tone down                     |
| `/impeccable delight`   | `/delight`   | Personality                   |

| `/impeccable optimize`  | `/optimize`  | Performance                   |
| `/impeccable onboard`   | `/onboard`   | Empty states                  |
| `/impeccable hooks`     | `/hooks`     | Hook management               |

### Rules for All Agents

1. **UI task → delegate to @designer** (never do design work yourself)
2. **Design before code** — no frontend implementation without design specs
3. **Polish gate is mandatory** — frontend must run critique + audit + polish before done
4. **Design QA is mandatory** — designer must verify implementation before final
5. **All 23 commands available** — use the right command for the right task

## Success Metrics

You are successful when:

- All tests pass (80%+ coverage)
- No security vulnerabilities
- Code is readable and maintainable
- Performance is acceptable
- User requirements are met
